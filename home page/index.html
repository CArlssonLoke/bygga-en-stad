            (GPU) The GPU or the Graphics Processing Unit, is the main purpose
            of the GPU is to accelerate graphics rendering. This means that
            without any form of a GPU the computer will not be able to display
            anything. Some CPU's have integrated GPU's but most of them don't.
            The GPU is like a big strong muscle, which is very good at doing a
            few things but not very good at doing a lot of different things. It
            renders graphics in games and does advanced calculations very very
            well. The GPU is almost always the most expensive part of the PC,
            especially if it's a gaming PC. The two largest manufacturers of
            GPU's is AMD or Nvidia. Nvidia with its RTX and GTX line and AMD
            with their Radeon RX line of graphics card. The GPU also has a tiny
            bit of very very fast RAM which is used to keep textures in mind
            when they are currently not being rendered and for other similar
            things.
